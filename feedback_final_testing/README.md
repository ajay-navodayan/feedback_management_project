## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sitare-feedback-system.git
   cd sitare-feedback-system
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   dbName=your_database_name
   user=your_database_user
   host=your_database_host
   DBPWD=your_database_password
   Client_id=your_google_oauth_client_id
   Client_secret=your_google_oauth_client_secret
   ```

5. Set up the PostgreSQL database and run the initial setup:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

6. Run the application:
   ```
   flask run
   ```

## Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL. Below is the schema for the main tables:

### Instructors Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE instructors (
    instructor_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    instructor_name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    instructor_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

### Courses Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(255),
    instructor_id INT,
    batch_pattern VARCHAR(10),
    UNIQUE (course_name, instructor_id, batch_pattern)
);
```

### Feedback Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE feedback (
    feedback_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    course_id INT REFERENCES courses(course_id),
    coursecode2 VARCHAR(50),
    studentemaiid VARCHAR(100),
    studentname VARCHAR(100),
    dateOfFeedback DATE,
    week INT,
    instructorEmailID VARCHAR(100),
    question1Rating INT,
    question2Rating INT,
    remarks TEXT
);
```

### Table Relationships

- The `courses` table has a foreign key relationship with the `instructors` table through the `instructor_id` field.
- The `feedback` table has a foreign key relationship with the `courses` table through the `course_id` field.

### Initial Data Setup

The system includes initial data setup for instructors and courses:

#### Instructors Data

```python
insert_instructors_query = """
INSERT INTO instructors (instructor_id, instructor_name, instructor_email)
VALUES
(3, 'Dr. Achal Agrawal', 'achal@sitare.org'),
(4, 'Ms. Preeti Shukla', 'preeti@sitare.org'),
...
ON CONFLICT (instructor_id) DO NOTHING;
"""
```

#### Courses Data

```python
insert_courses_query = """
INSERT INTO courses (course_name, instructor_id, batch_pattern)
VALUES
('Artificial Intelligence', 1, 'su-230'),
('DBMS', 1, 'su-230'),
...
ON CONFLICT (course_name, instructor_id, batch_pattern) DO NOTHING;
"""
```

Tables are created and initial data is inserted when the application starts via the `create_tables_if_not_exists()` function.

## Email Scheduler Setup

The application includes a feature to send automated email reminders. This is implemented in the `send_email()` function and scheduled to run every Saturday at 6:00 AM. To set this up:

1. Use an app-specific password for the sender email account. This is more secure than using your main account password.

2. To generate an app-specific password (for Gmail):
   - Go to your Google Account settings
   - Navigate to Security > App passwords
   - Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
   - Generate and copy the app password

3. Update the `smtp_password` in the `send_email()` function:

```python
def send_email():
    # ... other code ...
    smtp_password = "your_app_specific_password_here"  # Replace with your app-specific password
    # ... rest of the function ...
```

4. Ensure the `schedule` library is installed:

```
pip install schedule
```

5. The email scheduling is set up at the end of the script:

```python
schedule.every().saturday.at("06:00").do(send_email)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(60)  # Wait a minute before checking again
```

Note: Make sure to keep your app-specific password confidential and not commit it to version control. Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration file to store sensitive information.
